Filters can seem quite complicated; so here are some examples, so you can get some inspiration.

**Examples**:

• Set a filter:
-> `/filter hello Hello there! How are you?`

• Set a filter which uses the user's name through fillings:
-> `/filter hello Hello there {first}! How are you?`

• Set a filter on a sentence:
-> `/filter "hello friend" Hello back! Long time no see!`

• To save a file, image, gif, or any other attachment, simply reply to file with:
-> `/filter trigger`
