Sometimes, you just want to add some notes and filters to a group chat, but you don't want everyone to see; This is where connections come in...

This allows you to connect to a chat's database, and add things to it without the chat knowing about it! For obvious reasons, you need to be an admin to add things; but any member can view your data. (banned/kicked users can't!)

**Admin commands**:
• /connect <chatid>: Connect to the specified chat, allowing you to view/edit contents.
• /disconnect: Disconnect from the current chat.
• /reconnect: Reconnect to the previously connect chat
• /connection: See information about the currently connected chat.

You can retrieve the chat id by using the /id command in your chat. Don't be surprised if the id is negative; all super groups have negative ids.
