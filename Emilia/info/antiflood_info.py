You know how sometimes, people join, send 100 messages, and ruin your chat? With antiflood, that happens no more!

Antiflood allows you to take action on users that send more than x messages in a row. Actions are: ban/mute/kick/tban/tmute

**Admin commands**:

• /flood: Get the current antiflood settings
• /setflood <number/off/no>: Set the number of messages after which to take action on a user. Set to '0', 'off', or 'no' to disable.
• /setfloodtimer <count> <duration>: Set the number of messages and time required for timed antiflood to take action on a user. Set to just 'off' or 'no' to disable.
• /setfloodmode <action type>: Choose which action to take on a user who has been flooding. Possible actions: ban/mute/kick/tban/tmute

• /clearflood <on/off>: Whether to delete the messages that triggered the flood.

**Examples**:

• Set antiflood to trigger after 7 messages:
-> /setflood 7

-> /setfloodtimer 10 30s
