Anti Channel Mode is a mode to prevent unwanted channel actions.

**Admin Commands**:

• /antichannelmode `<on/yes>`: Enables Anti Channel Mode to ban users who chat using channels.
• /antichannelmode `<off/no>`: Disables Anti Channel Mode.
• /antichannelpin `<yes/no/on/off>`: Don't let telegram auto-pin linked channels. If no arguments are given, shows current setting.
• /cleanlinked `<yes/no/on/off>`: Delete messages sent by the linked channel.

**Note**: When using antichannel pins, make sure to use the /unpin command, instead of doing it manually. Otherwise, the old message will get re-pinned when the channel sends any messages.
