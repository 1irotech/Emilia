Save data for future users with notes!

Notes are great to save random tidbits of information; a phone number, a nice gif, a funny picture - anything!

**User commands**:
• /get <notename>: Get a note.
• #notename: Same as /get.

**Admin commands**:
• /save <notename> <note text>: Save a new note called "word". Replying to a message will save that message. Even works on media!
• /clear <notename>: Delete the associated note.
• /notes: List all notes in the current chat.
• /saved: Same as /notes.
• /clearall: Delete ALL notes in a chat. This cannot be undone.
• /privatenotes: Whether or not to send notes in PM. Will send a message with a button which users can click to get the note in PM.
